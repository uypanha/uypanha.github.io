description: "Teamwork, Made Simple. Bloo is a teamwork software that's both powerful and super-simple to use, which means your teams will love it and use it, and it will actually add value to your company.<br>

<br>• EASY - Anyone can use Bloo without any training or reading instructions!
<br>• POWERFUL - Bloo can power your entire business without breaking a sweat.
<br>• EVERYWHERE - Always online, 24/7/365. Use from any computer or smartphone to have all your data in one place.

<br><br>Keeping a growing team organized is difficult. You have to track communication, files, responsibilities, timelines, and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

<br><br>Group chats and email don't work for doing anything more than organizing drinks with friends, and the \"professional\" tools are too complex (and boring!), which means your teams don't actually use them!

<br><br>Bloo solves just this problem. It's a teamwork software that's both powerful and super-simple to use, which means your team will love it and use it, and it will actually add value to your company.

<br><br>Best thing? It's $50USD/month for unlimited projects, users, and files."
